# Week 3: Introduction to Ruby

<!-- Week 3's material is not ready yet!

We will release it with changes at least by the Friday before the week begins. -->

It's time to fetch changes from Pukeko's phase-0-unit-1 master repo to get the newly-released curriculum. Make sure you are in the master branch of your phase-0-unit-1 repo. Check where you are in your terminal first. DO NOT try fetching these changes into your [USERNAME].github.io repo. You will mess things up! Follow [these instructions](https://github.com/pukeko-2015/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/fetching-changes.md) for fetching changes.

On the student drive you have access to a number of different books. We recommend you purchase your own copy, but in the meantime you can use ours. This week you'll be reading Chris Pine's [*Learn to Program, 2nd edition*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgOWE3dF9tMzByVVk&authuser=0) and then completing the challenges we assign.

You will also want to read [The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://drive.google.com/a/enspiral.com/file/d/0B5aB0OHeInzgXzFFd1ZhT2lUTjA/view?usp=sharing) by David A. 
You will definitely also need to invest in [Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgcHFvZUVtNlZzQ3c&authuser=0) by Sandi Metz, (often referred to as POODR). This will be used in week 6 and through your bootcamp. 

## Challenges:
You'll see an "exercises" directory. The exercises will be referenced by the challenges below. Please go through the challenges in order.

Before starting, please read Chris Pine's Introduction p. xi - xv.

1. [Numbers, Letters, and Variable Assignment](1-numbers-letters)
2. [Variables and Methods](2-methods)
3. [Flow Control](3-flow-control)
4. [Arrays, Iterators, and Hashes](4-arrays)
5. [More Methods](5-more-methods)
6. [Fix the Errors](6-fix-the-errors)
7. [Technical Blog](7-technical-blog.md)
8. [Cultural Blog](8-cultural-blog.md)
9. [GPS 1.2](9-gps1-2) **Do not look at this until your guided pairing session!**
10. [Accountability Groups](10-accountability-groups.md)
11. [BONUS Challenges](11-BONUS-challenges) *Optional*

Please note, we put the blog challenges at the end of the week, but you can decide when to work on them. They may be helpful to do in the middle or when you're stuck in another challenge.

## Working through the challenges
Once you have the entire local repository on your computer, you don't need to read the challenges on GitHub anymore (although we admit, it's prettier). You can open the entire repository in Sublime and read the challenges in their original markdown. It will also help you find any link issues, since you can see where they are pointing. If you do find broken links, please let us know by posting on the community. You should also try to figure out a fix -- it will help your markdown skills!
