#U1.W3: Arrays, Iterators, and Hashes


## Learning Competencies
- Define and iterate over arrays
- Define and access values in a hash
- Apply string, array, hash, and/or enumerable methods

## Summary
So far you've used variables to store information, but what happens if you have a lot of information to store? Say you want to have a list of your favorite bands, and you are a bit of a music lover so there are hundreds of them. You wouldn't want to have to assign them like so:

```
String favorite_band_1 = "Evanescence";
String favorite_band_2 = "Nightwish";
String favorite_band_3 = "Linkin Park";
```

As you can see, this would take a while. Instead, it would be better to use a different structure to store this information.

## Releases

### Release 0

Head over to Enspiral's [NET REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info) 

* Username: devacademy
* Password: iamnice

Find the Labs section on the left hand menu and review [Lab 5 - Collections](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs).

Consulting documentation and reading example code is an integral part of being a developer, so make sure to re-read the Labs as your work through the following coding challenges.

### Release 1: Exercise - Defining a Hashtable

Open the [Defining a Hashtable](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/12) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_define_hash_table.cs](my_solution_define_hash_table.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 2: Exercise - Concatenating Two ArrayLists

Open the [Concatenating Two ArrayLists](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/13) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_concatenate_arrays.cs](my_solution_concatenate_arrays.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 3: Exercise - Calculate the Letter Grade from a Series of Grades

Open the [Calculate the Letter Grade from a Series of Grades](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/14) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_letter_grades.cs](my_solution_letter_grades.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 4: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/pukeko-2015/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
