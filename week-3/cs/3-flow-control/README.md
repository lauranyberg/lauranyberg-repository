#U1.W3: Flow Control

## Learning Competencies
- Logical operators
- Use conditionals (if, else, switch)

## Summary
Up to this point, you've had some pretty basic programs. You put something in; it spits something out. Now is your time to train your computer how to "think." You will be able to tell it to do something if something is true, and something different if something is false. This is called "flow control" (aka branching).

## Releases

### Release 0

Head over to Enspiral's [NET REPL](http://net-repl.enspiral.info) 

* Username: devacademy
* Password: iamnice

Find the Labs section on the left hand menu and review [Lab 4 - Branching](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/labs).

Consulting documentation and reading example code is an integral part of being a developer, so make sure to re-read the Labs as your work through the following coding challenges.

### Release 1: Exercise - Calculate a Letter Grade 

Open the [Calculate a Letter Grade](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/8) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_calculate_letter_grade.cs](my_solution_calculate_letter_grade.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 2: Exercise - Detecting Leap Years

Open the [Detecting Leap Years](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/9) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_detect_leap_years.cs](my_solution_detect_leap_years.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 3: Exercise - Good guess?

Open the [Good guess?](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/10) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_good_guess.cs](my_solution_good_guess.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!

### Release 4: Exercise - Detecting simple substrings

Open the [Detecting simple substrings](http://net-repl.enspiral.info/exercises/11) exercise on NET REPL and complete it following the instructions on the page.

Once you've completed the exercise, copy the code you wrote into the [my_solution_detect_substrings.cs](my_solution_detect_substrings.cs) file of this folder, add, commit and push!


### Release 5: Reflect
In your [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) use the [reflection guidelines](https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/phase-0-handbook/blob/master/coding-references/reflection-guidelines.md) to reflect on your learning. Remember, reflections should be directed toward an audience, but they don't need to be lengthy. A short paragraph will suffice. Try to keep your reflection writing to 10-15 minutes.
