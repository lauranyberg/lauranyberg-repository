## 2. GitHub Introduction Reflection

### From GitHub Introduction Challenge

- Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
- Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
- Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
- What doesn't make sense? What does?

### From Fork and Clone challenge
- Create your own step-by-step fork and clone instructions for later use
- What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
- Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?

## 1:Command Line Reflection
- What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
To be honest – pretty much everything.  I did not understand where I was, how I got back, etc. At this stage I feel very lost.  I had to keep referring back to the beginning information and even then I felt like it was confusing me more.
- Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
I was able to use them – but could not see what I was doing.  This is definitely something that I need to go back to as feel that I need to put OR get this explained to me and work through it with someone.  I am finding working through problems over slack difficult.
- Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd – print working directory
-ls – list directory
-grep - find things inside a file
-mv - move
-cd – change directory
-../ - parent directory
-touch - create new empty files
-mkdir – make directory
-echo - print some arguments
-less - page through a file
-rmdir – remove directory
-cat - print the whole file
-rm - remove file
-help 
-exit

## 2:Thinking About Time Reflection
- How do you manage your time currently?
I currently manage my time by getting home from work and taking a short break, perhaps 20mins. Then getting into the course. I will usually work until I feel frustrated, or something is not making sense and I need some time out.
- Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
Since I started this course on Monday – things have been a struggle and perhaps this is down to the way that I have managed my time so far.  However, in saying that, with the amount of writing that has to be undertaken in each category in the challenge I don’t know how this can not be done.
- What techniques did you look into during this challenge that interested you?
I really liked the Pomodoro Technique and will apply that from now on in.  As part of the prework to the course, we were asked to look at our learning styles – mine is a mulitmodel and then also a random/abstract thinker – who works better on reflection.  With the pomodoro technique having those breaks to be able to reflect could be beneficial for future learning.
- Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
Yes – as per above I will start by stopping every 25min for 5min to see how I then absorb the information.
- What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
I can only commit to 25 hours a week, due to my daily workload. This means that I have to be very smart about what I do.  I will work everynight for 3 hours during the week and then 5 hours on Saturday and Sunday.  I like to run, so I will be making sure that I do this at least three times a week for mental clarity.  

## 3: Introduction to Version Control, git, and GitHub
- Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience.
Git: Git is a version control system (VCSs). It’s run locally from your computer through the Terminal (Mac specific).  This is where you can create and clone repositoies, change and add features and then merge back to the original master repository, before pushing it to GitHub.
GitHub: GitHub is a platform that is run off the internet. This is the storage centre for all open source code, which developers can upload to from Git.  Since it is open source it is a social platform for other developers to come in and add/change and copy new or exisitng work in collaboration.
The two can not be compared because they are completely different in the function that they serve.  One is the work-horse, Git, and the other is the house that the work is stored in to be accessed and assesed, GitHub.
- Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
Version control is a system that allows you to create code that you can continusly iterate on. It allows you to save at every stage along the way, then go back and address any mistakes or additions through a projects life. GitHub helps with this by allowing it to store all repositories for developers that choose to use this platfrom.
- Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not
Developers use Git to make changes to code without ruining the master. It also allows them to work in collaboration with other developers remotely and at the same time.
- What doesn't make sense? What does?
At this point it seems pretty logical to me, but I think i need to have more practice at it to really say that 100%. Git is like your working file where you iterate until you are happy with the outcome and then you push it back to GitHub for review and to house.

## 4:Fork and Clone challenge
- What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I had a few, as again, was just not sure if i was doing the right thing. I am big on validation - as in, yes, you've done this right. I also feel that I need heaps more practice at this and at the moment feel that I am doing so much reading and less doing... which isn't probably the best for my learning style.
- Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?
I did feel that when I was forking and cloning I wasn't as challenged - as the video example was a winner! I did have to go back through the video a couple of times and also deleted the first repository to start again - but I think the more repetition I have of this, the better.
