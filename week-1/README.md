# Week 1: Git, GitHub, and the Command Line

**Welcome to Phase 0!** We hope you are excited to further your knowledge and begin integrating into the developer and Enspiral Dev Academy community. 

Before you get started, there are few essentials that you need to do. 

</br>
#### 1. Create Accounts
You will need each of these accounts for Phase 0. The general rule of thumb is to use your first name as part of your username wherever possible and include a photo of yourself.

- [Gmail](http://www.gmail.com)<br> We use Google Hangouts and Communities throughout Phase 0  **Make sure to activate Google+ on this account**. Please upload a photo of you (not your cat or bike) to help the Dev Academy community of staff, teachers, coaches and alumni recognise you.   

- [Gravatar](http://en.gravatar.com/)<br> You will get a Socrates account when you start Phase 0, and it will pull your picture from Gravatar. Please make sure your picture is of your face so we can get as much practice with your name as possible. 

- [Github](https://github.com/)<br> You will start using github today, so please create an account. **Please use your first name as part of your github user name.** This will be where you keep all of your code from EDA and becomes your technical resume when you apply for jobs.

- [Socrates](http://socrates.devbootcamp.com/)<br> You will receive an individual invite to socrates - The DevBoot Camp app that Dev Academy uses for activities like giving feedback. 

- [Slack](https://enspiral-dev-academy.slack.com/messages/pukeko-/)<br> You’ll receive an invite shortly to join our Slack channel. We’ll use Slack to help with quick fire questions and answers. You can also post files, notifications, and get help from the EDA and Pukeko community. We recommend using either the desktop app or have the web app signed on when you are working through the Phase 0 material.  

- [Google+](https://plus.google.com/communities/109221790027165688597)
By now you should have received an invite to your Pukeko Google+ community. If not, request it [here](https://plus.google.com/communities/109221790027165688597). We’ll use G+ to share non-urgent information and to organise Google Hangouts.

#### 2. Watch
The following videos introduce some key concepts of the Phase 0 experience.
You will be expected to be familiar with each of these upon starting Phase 0.

- Engineering Empathy: [EQ: Emotional Intelligence](https://vimeo.com/99779530) 15 min
- Giving and Receiving [Feedback](https://vimeo.com/99780302) 27 min
- Checking in before [Pairing](https://vimeo.com/76662569) 5 min
- Our collaborative coding editor [Stypi](https://vimeo.com/76870082) 2 min

</br>  

Please keep track of how much time you spend on the required sections of Phase 0 challenges. We'll ask you for this information in your weekly submission forms to gauge whether we are giving too much, the right amount, or not enough work each week.

When you have questions about the instructions or how to do something, are confused, or need help, please post on the Google+ community. Staff and students will post responses. You should never feel alone during Phase 0. Please reach out to us if you do - both Patrick and Jaime there to support you <patrick@devacademy.co.nz> or <jaime@devacademy.co.nz.>

## Submitting your work
- Each challenge will have its own set of instructions for submitting your work. In many instances you will be saving your work locally (on your own computer) and then pushing up to github where Patrick will review it. 
- Towards the end of each week, you will receive a link with a form to fill-in to submit links to your Github repository and files. If you haven't completed all the assignments by the end of the week please email your Phase 0 Facilitator to let them know.
- The week's work is due each Sunday be 11:59pm.


## Remember your Unit Requirements!
- Give feedback for each person you paired with, if any. You need to submit at least 6 pieces of feedback in this unit - 4 for peer pairing, and 2 for GPS. Each unit is 3 weeks long.
- Rate at least 7 pieces of [Meta Feedback](https://socrates.devbootcamp.com/feedback) on Socrates. (You need to rate 20 pieces of feedback per unit)
- Sign up for Guided Pairing Session (GPS) 1.1 and 1.2. Patrick will send you these invites. 


## Additional recommended activity 
- There is an online [student library of books](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgeWZoQm9VaWJQeWc&authuser=0) that we recommend you read. A popular place to begin for Rubyists is Chris Pine's [Learn to Programme](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgOWE3dF9tMzByVVk&authuser=0) and for C# [Head First Into C#](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5aB0OHeInzgNXhSQm9Uek9Rcmc&authuser=0)  
  
- There are range of online tutorials available - Students have recommended using either [team treehouse](http://teamtreehouse.com) or [code school](https://www.codeschool.com/hallpass) to support the learning material   While both are premium services, they are very worthwhile. Treehouse is **especially for visual and audio learners** and codeschool **especially good for kinesthetic learners**

- Make sure you familiarise yourself with the [Dev Academy Student handbook](). This has supplementary important information about pairing, feedback and all aspects of being a phase-0 student.
