# U1.W1: Sharpies! C# 
### Computer Set-Up Instructions

Now that you know a bit about your command line, you can now get your computer set up for EDA!

For the C# stream we highly recommend you work in a Windows environment. If you're using a Mac you can install Bootcamp and install a copy of Windows on the side of OS X.

Setting up your computer can be tricky, and there are specific technologies we will need you to have in Phases 0, 1, and 2. 

Please go through these instructions even if you already set up your machine just to check you have everything.

NOTE: These instructions assume you have a "clean" environment and don't have anything funky going on in your system. It should go smoothly if you have a clean system, but it may take significantly more time if you don't have a clean place to start from. Also, some of the commands will change the way your terminal/sublime look, so be prepared for that. You can always change it back. if you would prefer.
