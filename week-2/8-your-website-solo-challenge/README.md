# U1.W2: Your Website (Solo Challenge)

**THIS IS YOUR SOLO CHALLENGE FOR WEEK 2.** Please reference the [Phase 0 Handbook](https://github.com/enspiral-dev-academy/phase-0-handbook/) for more details as to what this entails.

## Learning Competencies
- Use wireframes to construct a website
- Use HTML tags to present content on a website
- Position HTML elements using CSS padding, borders, and margins
- Use CSS to add and format colors, fonts, icons, images, etc.

## Summary

In this challenge, you will make your [USERNAME].github.io site using the principles of design, site map, wireframe, and HTML and CSS you've learned this far. You may not use Bootstrap or any other design framework for your site.

Get creative. Have fun. But be conscious of time. This site will be a work in progress, so you should timebox how much time you want to spend on each part. You will be able to make improvements each week or unit if you dedicate the time to it. Make an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this version. Designing and building a site can take a **LONG TIME**, so just get your site "good enough" for your MVP. You can always make it better later!

Pomodoro is a common and effective timeboxing and productivity technique that we can use in this exercise. Basically you do 25 minutes of work, 5 minutes of break. You can use your own timer or this web application [moosti](http://www.moosti.com). Take a second and estimate how many units you want to work on each section, and see where you are by the end. Then you can decide if you want to continue adding more time. You will be improving your website as you go through the program. Don't burn out now!


## Releases

## Release 0: Wireframes
Reconsider the wireframe you created for your index.html in [3-wireframing](../3-wireframing). Do you need to make any changes to it based on what you've learned so far? You should be sure to include links to your social networks using icons and have a header and footer in the design.

You also need to make a wireframe for the index to your blog. This is where you will link to your blog posts. This will be called your blog/index.html. (It is different from your site index)!

## Release 1: Design
Now is the time to consider the colors, fonts, icons/logos, images and overall look and feel of your site. You may want to use some of the following resources:

- [Adobe Color CC](https://kuler.adobe.com/create/color-wheel/) to create a color theme for your site
- [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts) to consider fonts

You also may want to complete the bonus challenge, [Make a Mood Board](../12-BONUS-challenges/mood-board), to help you solidify your design.

Again, don't get bogged down trying to make your site perfect. Make it acceptable. You should make it a goal to revisit your site each week to add to it.

## Release 2: Development

#### Add Content using HTML
Using your wireframes and design as references, add content to your index.html page in your [USERNAME].github.io site using HTML.

Once you have all of the content on your index, you are ready to create your blog/index.html file. Be sure to add links to week 1's blog posts to it!

Remember, your website is a work in progress. Do not deviate from your wireframe until after you've built your MVP. Done is better than perfect.

#### Apply CSS
Now you can truly begin to appreciate CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. Each page can have a similar look if you use the same classes to format them the same.

- Add styling to your header and footer.
- Style and position the content to match your wireframe.
- Incorporate the colors, fonts, and format the images you've selected for your site.
- Add your personal touch to your blog template as well.

Don't forget about Chrome Devtools for testing out your style changes and figuring out if you are selecting elements correctly.

REMINDER: Are you being true to your MVP or are you working on new features? Don't deviate from your original wireframe until AFTER you've built your MVP.

## Release 3: More Pages! (OPTIONAL)
If you want to add more to your site, consider adding a sections for:

- Projects
- About me (or Contact)
- Anything else you want to share

## Release 4: Publish
When you feel ready to publish your new site, add your files to the stage, commit your changes, and push to master. Post your site on the G+ community and tell everyone on Slack to get some feedback.

## Release 5: Reflect
On your local `phase-0-unit-1` repo, edit the [my_reflection.md](my_reflection.md) file associated with this challenge. Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

## Release 6: Review (optional)
Check out your peers websites and leave comments as issues.
