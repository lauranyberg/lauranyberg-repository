# U1.W2: Connect with Your Stream.

## Learning Competencies
- Identify the concepts you struggled with
- Explain your confusion to your stream

## Summary
It's time to check in with your Stream (i.e. Rubiests or sharpies)! Your stream is your accountability group! 

Accountability groups are designed to give you a core group of people in your cohort to lean on and learn from. You will have a challenge to connect/meet with them each week. As a group you can decide to connect weekly via hangouts, slack, in person, or email.You will also get the chance to work with them on group challenges in later units, so it's important to start building relationships early. You may want to start a code review process within your accountability group as well.  

Your phase-0 facilitator will set up a private channel for accountability groups. You can use this, or one of the other means mentioned above. 

## Releases:
## Release 0: Identify Concepts
Identify one or two of the concepts/challenges you struggled with this week.

## Release 1: Discuss
Using the means your group decided to use for communication, explain the concepts that confused you and ask your accountability group members for help.

The other members of your group will have similar questions or can explain the parts that were confusing. Interact with one another and try to help each other out as much as possible.

## Release 2: Lack of Engagement
If there is a member of your group who does not engage, please email us to let us know. We will follow up with the person or provide you with aditional information.
